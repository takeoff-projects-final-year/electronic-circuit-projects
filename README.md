Electronic Circuit An electronic circuit is a system or network of interconnected electronic components that work together to perform a specific function. It consists of electronic components, such as resistors, capacitors, transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits, which are connected by conductive wires or traces on a circuit board. The purpose of the circuit can be to amplify, filter, modulate, or control electrical signals, among other functions. Electronic circuits are used in a wide range of devices, from simple calculators and radios to complex computers and communication systems.
